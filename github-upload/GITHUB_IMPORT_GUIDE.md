# GitHub Repository Import Guide

## Step 1: Download Your Project from Replit

1. **In your Replit project**, click the three dots menu (⋮) in the top-right corner
2. Select **"Download as zip"**
3. Save the ZIP file to your computer
4. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer

## Step 2: Create a New GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the **"+"** button in the top-right corner
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `finding-peace` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "Digital therapeutic conversation application for relationship building"
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 3: Upload Your Code to GitHub

### Option A: Using GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)

1. On your new repository page, click **"uploading an existing file"**
2. Drag and drop ALL files from your extracted project folder
3. Or click **"choose your files"** and select all project files
4. Add a commit message: "Initial commit - Finding Peace app"
5. Click **"Commit changes"**

### Option B: Using Git Command Line

1. Open terminal/command prompt in your extracted project folder
2. Run these commands:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Finding Peace app"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

## Step 4: Verify Upload

After uploading, your GitHub repository should contain:

- ✅ `README.md` - Project documentation
- ✅ `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- ✅ `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- ✅ `client/` - React frontend code
- ✅ `server/` - Express backend code
- ✅ `shared/` - Shared types and schema
- ✅ `mobile/` - React Native mobile app
- ✅ All other project files

## Step 5: Your Repository URL

Once uploaded, your repository URL will be:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME
```

For example: `https://github.com/johndoe/finding-peace`

## Step 6: Set Up for Others to Use

Anyone can now clone and run your project by:

1. Cloning: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git`
2. Installing dependencies: `npm install`
3. Setting up environment: `cp .env.example .env` (and editing with their database)
4. Running: `npm run dev`

## Important Notes

- **Database**: Others will need to set up their own PostgreSQL database
- **Environment Variables**: They'll need to configure their own `.env` file
- **Dependencies**: All dependencies are listed in `package.json`
- **Mobile App**: The `/mobile` directory contains the complete React Native app

## Next Steps

After creating your GitHub repository, you can:

1. **Deploy the web app** to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or Railway
2. **Set up CI/CD** for automatic deployments
3. **Collaborate** with others by sharing the repository URL
4. **Track issues** and feature requests using GitHub Issues
5. **Create releases** for version management

Your Finding Peace app is now ready for GitHub and can be shared with others!
