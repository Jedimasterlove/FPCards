How much of this current energy is from transference?**\nTransference is when feelings from a past relationship (especially early caregivers) are unconsciously placed onto the present person.\n- Am I reacting to this person as if they are someone from my past?\n- Is my emotional reaction disproportionate to the current moment?\n- What unmet need or past pain might be surfacing now?\n\n**üéØ 2. How much of this energy is from projection?**\nProjection is when I disown a part of myself and place it on someone else.\n- Am I accusing them of something I myself have done, feared, or felt?\n- Am I trying to avoid facing something in myself by focusing on them?\n- What truth about me might this conflict be pointing toward?\n\n**üîÑ 3. In which BRPEs am I engaging?**\nThe BRPEs (Blame, Rescue, Protest, Escape) are common shame-based strategies we use to avoid feeling pain or powerlessness.\n- Blame: Am I focusing all attention on their faults or wrongdoings?\n- Rescue: Am I trying to fix or manage their feelings to avoid discomfort?\n- Protest: Am I complaining or acting out instead of expressing my needs clearly?\n- Escape: Am I withdrawing, numbing, or shutting down to avoid vulnerability?\n\n**ü§ê 4. I am using the BRPEs to cope with how I am feeling. I do it in hopes that...**\nFinish this sentence honestly. What unconscious strategy are you using to get a need met or avoid a feeling?\n\n**ü™û 5. How often do I do the very thing I am protesting or blaming my partner for?**\nThis is a humbling and powerful question.\n- Am I holding them to a standard I do not live by myself?\n- What part of me does this conflict reveal?\n- Where might I be showing up in similar ways, even if unintentional?\n\n**üßä 6. In what ways does the other person actually do the opposite of what I am blaming them for?**\nThis challenges the black-and-white thinking that can dominate conflict.\n- Have there been times they have shown up, cared, or connected?\n- Can I acknowledge a more balanced view of their behavior?\n\n**‚ö†Ô∏è 7. In my current emotional state, I am more likely to...**\nGet honest about your patterns in dysregulation.\n- Am I more likely to lash out, collapse, shut down, or cling?\n- Is this aligned with who I want to be in this relationship?\n- What would the most grounded version of me choose here?\n\n**üôà 8-9. What am I choosing not to see? What am I pretending to ignore?**\nThis is a call to face truths we have been avoiding.\n- Am I ignoring my own role, the other person's humanity, or a pattern I do not want to change?\n- What signals or truths have I been pushing aside?\n\n**üëÇ 10. How well have I listened with empathy to the other person?**\nBe honest:\n- Did I let them finish their thoughts?\n- Did I ask clarifying questions or reflect their feelings?\n- Did I create space for their truth, or was I preparing my rebuttal?\n\n**üßç 11-12. How am I making this all about me? What part of this conflict is mine?**\nSometimes, we center our pain so much that we forget to see the other person as a separate human being.\n- Am I framing the whole situation only in terms of how it affects me?\n- What am I responsible for‚Äîemotionally, behaviorally, energetically?\n\n**üìè 13. How much am I owning?**\nRate your ownership on a scale from 1‚Äì10.

What Is the Opposite of Those Negative Core Beliefs?**\nFor every shame-based belief, there is an equal and opposite truth rooted in compassion and worth.\n- If the belief is 'I am unlovable,' then the opposite might be 'I am deeply worthy of love and belonging.'\n- If the belief is 'I am a failure,' the truth might be 'I am learning and growing with every experience.'\n- Write the opposite statement, even if it feels hard to believe at first.\n\n**üíû 3.

Soften your jaw and shoulders\n- Ask internally: 'What is the deeper truth beneath the fear or shame?'\n\n**üîç 6. What Is the Truth‚ÄîAbout Me? About the Other Person? About This Situation?**\nLet go of extremes. Look for both/and. This is about clarity, not perfection.\n- About Me: 'I am human. I made a mistake, but I am not a mistake. I am learning.'\n- About the Other Person: 'They may be hurting too. Their actions do not define my worth.'\n- About This Situation: 'It is painful, but it is also an opportunity for growth, healing, and choice.'",

Avoid explaining your intentions or justifying your behavior.\nExample: 'Your hurt makes complete sense. Anyone would feel this way.'\nValidation helps them feel less alone in their pain and opens the door to healing.\n\n**3. Acknowledge the impact**\nTake full responsibility for the effect of your actions, even if your intentions were different. Acknowledge how your behavior affected them emotionally, relationally, or practically. Own the impact completely.\nExample: 'I can see how my distance activated your abandonment wound, and that added to your suffering. That is on me.'\nImpact matters more than intent‚Äîown the effect without defensiveness.\n\n**4. Clarify what might help address the pain**\nAsk what they need for healing and offer to take meaningful steps to support that process.

Then, follow through.\nExample: 'What would help you feel more safe and supported right now?'\n'Going forward, I will check in with you directly rather than shutting down.'\nAmends are only healing when followed by consistent change.\n\n**5. Share how you feel about your actions**\nEnd by letting them into your own emotional process‚Äînot to shift the focus to yourself, but to show genuine care and self-reflection. Express remorse, tenderness, or grief about the impact of your behavior.\nExample: 'I feel heavy and deeply regretful about how I showed up.

Multiple strategies equal more freedom and flexibility.\n\n**Are We Clear on the Goal or Outcome?**\nBefore jumping into action or problem-solving, check in:\n- Do we both understand and agree on the goal of this conversation?\n- Are we trying to resolve a specific conflict? Reconnect emotionally? Establish a boundary? Repair a rupture?\n\nExamples:\n- 'Just to check‚Äîare we both hoping this talk helps us feel more connected and understood?'\n- 'Before we move forward, are we clear on what we are trying to accomplish together?'\n\nWhy this matters: A shared goal helps keep the conversation focused and productive‚Äîand prevents going in circles.\n\n**Final Reflection**\n'If we were fully aligned in love, curiosity, and compassion‚Äîhow would we handle this together?'\nLet that vision guide your choices.",
